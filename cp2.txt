## Scenario:
A hospital’s IT systems are infected by ransomware, locking access to patient records and halting ongoing surgeries. The attackers demand cryptocurrency payment to restore access to the systems.

## Question 1: What Cybersecurity Principles Are Violated Here (CIA Triad)?

The **CIA Triad** represents the three fundamental principles of cybersecurity: **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**. All three are violated in this scenario:
| **Confidentiality** | Patient records may be exposed or accessed by unauthorized attackers. |
| **Integrity** | Medical records could be altered, deleted, or tampered with during or after the attack. |
| **Availability** | Hospital systems are locked; surgeries and critical care are disrupted due to inaccessibility of data. |

##Question 2: How Are PII and CII Involved in This Situation?

### **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)**:
- Includes patient names, medical histories, addresses, IDs, prescriptions, and test reports.
- Exposure or misuse of PII can result in **identity theft**, **privacy breaches**, and **legal violations** (e.g., HIPAA in the U.S., PDPB in India).

### **CII (Critical Information Infrastructure)**:
- Hospitals, especially during emergencies (like pandemics), are considered **critical infrastructure**.
- Disruption of health systems impacts **national safety**, emergency services, and public trust.
- In India, health infrastructure may fall under **CII if declared by NCIIPC**.

##Question 3: Cybersecurity Framework the Hospital Should Adopt

To prevent such attacks in the future, the hospital should adopt a robust cybersecurity framework that includes:

### A. **Framework Recommendation**:
**NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** – Widely adopted and adaptable for healthcare organizations.

### B. **5 Core Functions of NIST CSF**

| Function | Hospital Implementation |
|----------|--------------------------|
| **Identify** | Conduct risk assessments, classify assets (servers, EHR systems), and identify critical data. |
| **Protect** | Implement firewalls, anti-malware, endpoint protection, encryption, and access control (MFA). |
| **Detect** | Deploy real-time threat monitoring (SIEM), anomaly detection, and intrusion detection systems. |
| **Respond** | Create an incident response plan (IRP), train staff for ransomware response, report incidents to CERT-In. |
| **Recover** | Maintain offsite backups, disaster recovery plans (DRP), and ensure business continuity processes. |
